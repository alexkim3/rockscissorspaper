# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a basic python implementation of the game rock/paper/scissors. There are 3 rounds, and the one with the higher score wins. If you want to play the game with the `pyglet` library, open `rockpaperscissors_with_graphics.py`. Otherwise, open `rockpaperscissors.py` in the command line.
